# Hirschberg-algorithm-on-global-alignment
An implementation of the global sequence alignment using hirschberg algorithm in Python.

## Project Overview

This project uses Python to implement a global sequence alignment algorithm, useful for foundational bioinformatics sequence analysis tasks. It leverages dynamic programming to compute the optimal alignment path and score between two sequences. The goal for using hirschberg algorithm it to keep the runing space in linear.

### Motivation

While learning sequence alignment algorithms, I found it challenging to understand how hirschberg algorithm work and how alignment paths are formed. To enhance my understanding, I developed this project. It viually compare the score and alignment for both global alignment with needleman_wunsch algorithm and hirschberg algorithm. Also it will show the difference of space usage between two implementation.


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- You can try to download the two .py file and run localy
